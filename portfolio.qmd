While most of what I do now involves coding and data visualization, I've worked on a variety of different written academic papers since I've been at GWU. Some of them can be accessed below by clicking on the link.

## Academic Papers


My freshman year research paper that observes how the perception of female sexuality has evolved throughout history, pulling from multiple historical journals and other research papers with similar cause:

Access it: ["Female Sexuality: 
How the Historical Perception Influences the Contemporary View"](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PU2isaP_yhn561FKpj-Sz8lZA7hOz0k6RszMM9OOVfQ/edit?usp=sharin>).

A collaborative paper written by myself and classmates that observes the organizational layout of Trader Joe's, examining how the corporation has created a culture and influence that vastly differs from its competition and how that has helped shape its public perception:

Access it: ["Organizational Analysis of Trader Joe's"](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FydmN7Ac6h12lz5fja2o5--BydKf5OnB98IBnp3zDno/edit?usp=sharing>)

The beat I chose to report on during a semester in an advanced news writing class dealt with public health. 
As one of several pieces I wrote for my beat, the following paper was written just before Roe v. Wade was overturned and it looks at the development of how such a decision was made. 

Access it: ["Kentucky Abortion Ban News Story"](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4Haofr5YlLxGMBhDI7sjdAsdgadbXElRpyrH2vZYf0/edit?usp=sharing>).
