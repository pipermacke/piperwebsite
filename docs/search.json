    "text": "First we have to load in packages to analyze the data, which we do like this:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nOnce these packages are loaded, we need to load in the data we will be using. Assuming we have already downloaded the csv file containing the data, this is how we do that:\nimpeach <- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRh8d5JaDqBtByzNw2JZF3idaACobDhhk-p7chJoktA0HawELHFOvjQOqCpzGA4MGONvPlR7GASqW-K/pub?gid=1765341510&single=true&output=csv\")\nNow we can analyze the data.\n----------\nIf we wanted to get only results from those who voted against Trump’s impeachment, we would need to use the filter() command, like so:\nfilter(impeach, for_impeachment == 'NO')\nWe command R to filter the for_impeachment column to only show outputs of “NO”, so it gives us all the results of those within the data set that voted against impeachment.\n----------\nIf we wanted to specify results even further, we could filter the results to show those who both voted against impeachment and were a member of a district Trump won in 2016.\nfilter(impeach, for_impeachment == 'NO',\n       p16winningparty == 'R')\nSince we already have a column distinguishing the members by district (named “p16winningparty”), all we have to do is set it to show those with output “R”.\n----------\nNow if we wanted to specify even further, say for those who voted against impeachment, were from a district Trump won in 2016, and were from a district Mitt Romney won in 2012, we would do the following:\nfilter(impeach, for_impeachment == 'NO', \n       p16winningparty == 'R', \n       p12winningparty == 'R')\nWe just use the column p12winning party this time, and set it to give outputs of “R”.\n----------\nIf we wanted to filter for those who voted for impeachment in the month of September 2019:\nfilter(impeach, for_impeachment == 'YES',\n       date_month == 9,\n       date_year == 2019)\nAs you can see, we use both the date and year to get the desired output.\n----------\nTo get members that voted for impeachment and are from a district where Clinton won more than 70% of the vote in 2016:\nfilter(impeach, for_impeachment == 'YES',\n       clinton_percent > 70.0)\nWe can use the “greater than” symbol to specify results to ones that are larger than the desired number we’re looking for, which in this case in 70.\n----------\nWe can also sort the data.\nSay we want to sort the data according to the percentage of district populations with a bachelor’s degree or higher:\nimpeach %>% \n  arrange(pct_bachelors)\nThis will automatically arrange the data in ascending order, from lowest to highest percentage.\n----------\nIf we wanted the same sorting, but only for those who voted against impeachment:\nimpeach %>% \n  filter(for_impeachment == 'NO') %>% \n  arrange(pct_bachelors)\nThen we only get results where for_impeachment is a “NO”.\n----------\nSorting by bachelor’s degree, we can also see results from those who are against impeachment and whose district’s bachelor’s percentage is below the national average:\nimpeach %>% \n  filter(for_impeachment == 'NO', \n         pct_bachelors_compared_to_national == 'BELOW') %>%\n  arrange(pct_bachelors)\n----------\nWe can also filter results to those who are against impeachment and are all from the same specific state.\nimpeach %>% \n  filter(for_impeachment == 'NO', \n         state == 'NJ')\nIn this case, we only get results for members who are against impeachment and from New Jersey.\n----------\nIf we wanted to see those who voted for impeachment at a certain time and then sort the results, we could do the following:\nimpeach %>% \n  filter(for_impeachment == 'YES', \n         date_year < 2019) %>%\n  arrange(desc(clinton_percent))\nIn this case, we see those who were a “YES” to impeachment, declared before the year 2019, and the results are then sorted in order from highest to lowest Clinton vote percentages.\n----------\nThere is another command, nrow(), that will give you the rows left in a dataset after you have filtered the results, so you can see just how many people fit each of your specifications. Here’s an example on how to use it with this dataset:\nnrow(impeach %>% \n    filter(for_impeachment == 'NO', gdp_above_national == 'BELOW'))\nThis result gives us the total number of members against impeachment who come from districts with a GDP below the national figure.\n----------\nSo, with this foundation of filtering and sorting, there are plenty of more complicated concepts that call for these kinds of specifications. It’s common for coding with data analysis to involve different filters and subsets in order to get meaningful percentages and look at correlations within datasets, so that’s what we’ve gone through here."

    "text": "For the first time in history, men might get to understand what it’s like being “on the pill.”  \nA new compound designed to sterilize male mice has shown a 99% efficacy rate over just a four-week testing period. The research is being headed by collaborators at Columbia University and has so far yielded impressive results.  \nChemist and Head of the Department for Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Gunda Georg, Ph.D., spoke in a media briefing last Wednesday on the study.  \n“You have to be careful with this analysis - these are mice; they are not humans, but nevertheless, the effect was very, very promising,” George said. \nThe main challenge in developing the compound currently being tested on mice was targeting a specific protein while still maintaining healthy, viable subjects. \nOne of the greatest promises the research has shown is that the mice that were given the compound for several weeks seemed to have “no side effects whatsoever,” according to Georg. \nFinding a working compound to cause reversible infertility in men is still in the very early stages and won’t be tested on humans until it has been cleared to do so by the Food and Drug Administration.  \nIn which case, the soonest a working birth control pill for males could be developed is about five years from now.  \nStill, the most important indicator of its overall success depends on how willing men are to take it. \nDr. Jesse Mills, director of the Men’s Clinic at UCLA, speculates that the male birth control pill will be significantly more popular among men in committed relationships opposed to men who are not. \nHe also pointed out an important discrepancy in how often men and women use the procedures already available to them.  \n“Our track record as a gender for assuming birth control responsibility is not stellar. Women overwhelmingly outnumber men for going through surgical sterilization procedures even though a female tubal ligation is far more invasive than a vasectomy,” Mills said.  \nWhen a 22-year-old male university student in a committed, heterosexual relationship of several months was anonymously asked if he would take the male birth control pill, he did not hesitate to say yes. \n“My girlfriend has had a tough time with the birth control she’s tried. So, if there was a good birth control pill for men, I would absolutely take it instead,” the source said. \nThe answer differed slightly for a 22-year-old male university student that was not in a relationship.  \n“I wouldn’t be opposed, but I would prefer not to. Kinda scary to think about down the line,” the source said. \nMD Abdullah al Noman, graduate student at the University of Minnesota Institute for Therapeutics Discovery and Development, said that this male-to-female discrepancy occurs as a result of men not having the “trade up” between the side effects of birth control and pregnancy, unlike women.  \nBeing that there are, at minimum, several years before a male birth control pill would be open to use by the public, there is hope that this discrepancy could still be minimized.  \nRegardless, taking the steps to develop a male birth control in the first place is optimistic for millions of women suffering from the harsh side effects of methods that already exist.  \nIf a working oral contraceptive for men is successfully developed, the idea that Georg quoted as “reproductive choice for all” is a real possibility."

    "text": "Especially as an 18-year-old female in her first year of college (granted it was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic), I saw how the perception of female sexuality was viewed from many different perspectives. So, in researching and creating this paper, I explored what female sexuality looked like through the scope of different regions of the world throughout different decades in history.\n\nFemale Sexuality: How the Historical Perception Influences the Contemporary View\n\nPiper Macke\nAbstract\nDespite society having begun to evolve to make feminine sexuality less taboo, the historical perception of women and sex has led it to be an issue that is still frowned upon and does not receive the same attention as its male counterpart. The project aims to support why this topic should be implemented more seriously into education as a possible first step in solving it as an issue on the basis of persisting male and female inequality. Historical and contemporary examples of female sexuality are presented to highlight how the negative foundation it was developed upon has influenced how it is seen today. The project discusses historical factors that impact the way the world currently sees feminine sexuality such as premartial sex, gender norms, and societal expectations. In addition, contemporary examples of pornography consumption, motives for sex, and commonly-believed sexual myths are included to highlight how these historical instances have paved the way for a underrepresented, undereducated,  viewpoint on women and sex.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThough it’s become less taboo to discuss female sexuality in the modern world, there still exist numerous misconceptions regarding its realities. The way male and female sexuality is discussed in a formal and informal context shows a stark difference in societal opinion, and this divide leads to a lack of understanding of women and sex. For example, looking to Cindy Meston and Amelia Stanton’s scholarly article entitled “Recent Findings on Women\\’s Motives for Engaging in Sexual Activity,” it was proven through a variety of questionaires that women have sex for the same reasons men do, though it is rarely discussed, especially in a positive manner. In this article, women were asked to classify their motives for sex into one or more of four main categories, being: Physical, goal attainment, emotional, and insecurity. Not surprisingly, it was found that women in different relationship stages (i.e. single, dating, married, recently out of a breakup, etc.) responded differently. However, most notable from this survey is that women who were single and engaging in casual sex were most motivated by physical factors, whether it be attraction to their partner or personal pleasure (Meston and Stanton, 2017). While this in itself is not surprising, it is a fact that both holds a negative connotation in society and is very infrequently discussed in the same manner it is with men also being motivated purely out of physical factors. Because this discussion does not extend to women engaging in the same behavior, it is perceived more wrongful than natural even though there exists no solid foundation to support such a belief.\nPerhaps a reasoning for this lack of female representation as it relates to discussions about sexuality is the fact that women are perceived to have lower sex drives than their male counterparts. Therefore, the idea that they may be engaging in sexual activity to the same degree as men comes as a shock as it does not seem feasible. However, this assumption has been proven false on various occasions. In Katherine Rowland\\’s article in which she herself interviewed 120 women of different ages across the country, she concluded that the perceived lower sex drive of women is, \\“less the result of faulty biology than evidence of sound judgment\\” (Rowland, 2020). What she goes on to explain further is that, while all women suffer dips in sexual desire at different points in their lives, it is more so because of less-than-satisfactory sex than it is because of a reluctance to engage in sexual activity in the first place. While this itself is not surprising, it is a result of a lack of education of the female anatomy and a suppression of the conversation about feminine sexuality as to advance the discussion of male sexuality as its primary concern.\nIt is also important to mention that this lack of attention to sexually active women stems from the continued historical suppression and repelling of the idea of female sexuality. Such an instance is relayed in Lynn Botelho’s “Old women and sex: fear, fantasy, and a defining life course in Early Modern Europe.” In her scholarly article, Botelho mentions how the perception of feminine sexuality is partially formed by the historical view of witchcraft that aimed to defile the teachings of Christianity. Early modern social order enforced the role of women to be that of the housewife; they were expected to do the cleaning, cooking, and nurturing of their children. Witches, on the other hand, “foiled the process of creation” (Botehlo, 2015) with their threat to society’s sexual repression of women and expectation to engage in reproduction. Likewise, women that were old enough to no longer have a house to keep, children to foster, or a husband to satisfy were also opposers to the teachings of celibacy and purity that Christianity so heavily enforced. As a result, the constant fear of what witches and old women tempted sexually remained a justification for the suppression of their sexuality. This suppression only persisted throughout history as there were no real movements to combat it for centuries.\nIn addressing the issue of how female sexuality is negatively perceived today, I hope to give historical instances where it can be clearly seen that it is the result of an existing problem. I hope to also include justification as to why it is important to address the reality of sexually active women as a necessary step in closing the patriarchal divide between men and women in all areas of life. With the several articles, testimonies, and facts I have reviewed, I have found multiple instances that indicate how doing so is a viable and imperative solution to solving this problem. With an education more focused on the health of both men and women in a sexual context, the collective attitude towards feminine sexuality can be transformed into one that is accepted as positive and necessary to advance an ideally equal society.\n\n\nMethods \nIn conducting my research, I sought to find a variety of sources regarding the date they were published and/or the era in which they gave information about. I wanted to give information both on the historical perception of female sexuality as well as the contemporary viewpoint. That being so, I primarily utilized GW’s virtual library databases. I used JSTOR to collect most of my sources, using keywords such as “women,” “sex,” “sexuality,” and “female sexuality” to find the large part of my scholarly sources. \nI knew from personal experience how men and women are spoken of differently when it pertains to their sexual activity, and I aimed to explore why this occurred and how it may be linked to the historical suppression of female sexuality. What I found proved my hypothesis, being that most of the historical documents I read and included showed that the reason for this suppression is a result of a long-living historical trend. In my methodology, I hoped to provide solutions for how the gradual introduction into this conversation may occur. \nIn selecting the sources I would go on to use in my project, I considered if they were credible and had sufficient information for the points I wanted to make. Therefore, I attempted to use more scholarly journals instead of other forms of research even though it may have made my points much clearer. I wanted the research I included to be a continuation of my argument for a more natural integration of female sexuality into existing conversation, not for the research to be my argument. \nIn the sources I used that were not scholarly or peer reviewed, I made sure the author, organization, and research methods were reliable before including them. Some of the information I sought to find was too specific for a scholarly journal, so I looked to other organizations that may have begun their own research in the field of feminine sexuality. \nOverall, the research I chose to include in my project is reliable and serves as a continuation of my argument regarding women and sex. I aim to interpret the outside research I use in a manner that advances my personal observations of the discussion of sex in the modern world.\n\n\n\n\nResults\nHistorical Perspective\nTo advance aforementioned points regarding how male and female sexual activity is viewed differently, Lindsay Moore supports in her academic journal “Single Women and Sex in the Early Modern Atlantic World” that there are numerous instances in which the different views on the same behavior of men and women became apparent in a legal regard. In 17th century England, women were frequently brought to court on accounts of engaging in illegal sexual activity. They then had to rely on claims such as a “broken marriage contract” or being seduced and coerced by their master to prove their innocence and hope for their acquittal (Moore, 2010). Occurrences such as these were very common in the early modern world, and advance a further issue when it is also noted that the male counterparts of actions such as forniaction and bastardy were prosecuted much less frequently. As Moore mentions in her article, this is partly due to the collective attitude towards sex and gender as well as the socioeconomic status of the women involved. Women were easily discredited as authorities in England and Massachusetts Bay relied on Protestant teachings as a justification for their judgements.\nReliance upon religious teachings to justify certain attitudes towards sex is a theme that is extremely frequent throughout history. However, there are certain occasions that serve as a counterpoint to this very rigid commonality. For example, in Nancy Landale and Avery Guest’s scholarly article entitled “Ideology and Sexuality among Victorian Women,” research is cited by Stanford historian Carl Delger in which sexual relations among Victorian women “‘were neither rejected nor engaged in with distaste or reluctance’” (Guest and Landale, 1986). Essentially, this then serves to contrast the very opposite viewpoint that existed in most other time periods and areas around the world. This trend is also very rare and serves as one of the very few examples of women in history being able to freely express and converse about their sexuality. \nContemporary Perspective\nAs time goes on and social interaction becomes more reliant on technology and online apps, the sexuality of women is affected in a different way that involves a constant comparison to those they are exposed to online. In furthering this claim, Stefanie Davis cites in her academic journal entitled “Objectification, Sexualization, and Misrepresentation: Social Media and the College Experience” dozens of examples in which social media conversation served as the medium for discussions about female sexualization, the male gaze, gender roles, and how celebrities on such a platform are held in such a high regard speaking on these issues. One of the important points Davis mentions in her article is how social media can also perpetuate rape culture, as the internet serves as a, “celebration of male sexual conquests, slut shaming, and sexualization of women” (Davis, 2018). Such an occurrence stems from the fact that those with the most influence or strongest opinions are usually at the forefront of such conversations online. Therefore, anyone may be subjected to a discussion that is headed by those with outdated or wrongful perceptions of issues such as female sexuality. \nIn contrast, the same social media discussions affect the opposite end of the spectrum, as “postfeminist empowerment” is displayed by popular celebrities advocating for women to be comfortable in their bodies and sexuality. For example, Davis also mentions how popular child Disney star Miley Cyrus once posted on Twitter that she was a “freak” to empower herself and her impressionable followers. With this being one of many instances of Cyrus publicly breaking the mold of innocent young actors, she was constantly met with backlash. While there have been countless celebrities that saw a negative reaction from the rest of society for similar displays, it presents the very common response to women expressing themselves in ways they are not expected to. \nIt is also important to mention that there would be no need for celebrities to advocate for feminine sexual health, education, or empowerment if it was seen in the same manner as its male counterparts. Social media stars would not need to come forward as heroes of modern feminism if it wasn’t a problem that was cemented into the foundations of society. While doing so is a very necessary step in breaking down the negative perception of female sexuality now, it is a problem that could’ve been avoided with adequate education and societal acceptance. \n\n\nDiscussion\nMy argument here advances in that if the conversation about female sexuality were to be encouraged throughout history rather than shunned or silenced, there would be much less of a divide in the way men and women are treated in every area of work, education, society, and life in general. In the beginning of the 20th century, the mere recognition of feminine sexuality was a new idea in itself. When it was looked into even further, it was collectively agreed upon that this revolutionary idea was different than that of the male and, as stated by Michael Gordon and Penelope Shankweiler, “essentially dependent upon him for its arousal and satisfaction\\” (Gordon and Shankweiler, 1971). Women were therefore not seen as beings with needs that were independent of male influence, and this attitude is one that lives on within many different spheres of life. \nThis viewpoint only advances the already patriarchal makeup of society insofar as that it presents a foundation for men to be seen as superior to women. Through this perspective, men are a necessary force in a woman’s awakening of sexual desire, not accounting for the fact that this awakening could be completely due to other factors. In addition, this attitude lends itself to the favoring of females with certain “desirable” traits. With a subconscious belief that women are to be introduced to male-dominated activity, it’s also reasonable to believe that this would lead to certain females being favored within society if they are seen as more submissive. In a study conducted by Pew Research Center in which 4,573 Americans answered the question of what words society uses to describe men and women, there is a very obvious trend that presents their desirable and undesirable traits. Women that were “beautiful” were always talked about positively, as well as if they were “kind” or “compassionate.” Men, on the other hand, were discussed positively if they presented themselves as “strong,” “honest,” or “powerful” (Bialik et al., 2021). When women were described as having these characteristics, it was much more commonly seen as a negative trait. While this is only one glaring example of how men are seen as the dominant sex socially, it can easily be translated to the way they are expected to be dominant sexually as well.\nIt is also shocking that the results of Donald Mosher’s (1979) study of sexual myths seem to refute the proclaimed superiority of men in a sexual context. In a survey of almost 100 male and female students at the University of Connecticut, 41 sexual myths were presented to the subjects and they were to decide themselves if they were true or not based on their prior knowledge. In the survey, men reported believing significantly more myths than women, with most being focused on the female side of sexual intercourse, such as orgasm or masturbation. Mosher attributes this tendency of men to believe sexual myths to both the “homosocial” male conversation regarding sex and pornography catered towards the male population (Mosher, 1979). This occurrence is clearly the result of a lack of education, though it could be from a variety of subjects such as female health, anatomy, biology, or sexual education in general. It is because of this proven tendency that it must become more of a priority to educate both men and women about the realities of sex as to both normalize this basic human behavior and decrease sexual guilt. \nIf the historical norms that created the stigma surrounding female sexuality continue to be a functioning aspect of society, it will only further the divide between men and women in every area of life. Young, impressionable girls and boys are constantly at risk of misinformation, especially as internet access gets exponentially easier. If the historical perception of women and sex is one that continues to be of lesser regard than male sexuality, it is likely that the lack of education and awareness surrounding the topic will never be fixed. \nThe need for sexual education especially of the youth that is just becoming introduced to new desires is essential. In the various studies that I have included, it is clear that there exists a very obvious lack of knowledge regarding the female side of any sexual activity. This is evident for both men and women and serves as a problem that must be solved as to consequently aid in the resolving of other aspects of society that deem women as inferior to men.\nAs technology continues to reach a wider and more diverse audience, this education may begin in the form of social media apps or with the help of popular celebrities. It can be argued that in the 21st century there exists a new sexual revolution that recognizes female sexuality and sees sex itself as a basic human need. However, the resolution to the continued lack of education regarding the masculine and feminine side of sexuality lies in the fact that this sexual revolution must be wholly accepted and nurtured into society.\n\n\nReferences\nBialik, K., Kessel, P., & Walker, K.
