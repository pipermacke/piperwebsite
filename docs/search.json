The data collection process for this project was also relatively straightforward and not too complicated, so it did make what is normally a longer process a bit easier.\nSo you can see how the actual data was transformed into a page of butterflies, I’ve included a table using the numerical and categorical data in the csv file."

Here’s an example on how to use it with this dataset:\n\nnrow(impeach %&gt;% \n    filter(for_impeachment == 'NO', gdp_above_national == 'BELOW'))\n\n[1] 19\n\n\nThis result gives us the total number of members against impeachment who come from districts with a GDP below the national figure.\n----------\nSo, with this foundation of filtering and sorting, there are plenty of more complicated concepts that call for these kinds of specifications. It’s common for coding with data analysis to involve different filters and subsets in order to get meaningful percentages and look at correlations within datasets, so that’s what we’ve gone through here."

    "text": "Completed: Fall 2022\nAssignment: For this project, I was given real data from the 2020 presidential election in the state of Virginia. I was to find relationships between variables and show information I found interesting using R packages. The following is a walkthrough of my completion of the project, with comments included in the code.\n\nLet me also note here that this is my very first RStudio visualization project. But I’m keeping it here (unedited) to show how far I’ve come!\n\nFirst we’ll need to load the necessary libraries so our code works right. For this project, I used “DT”, “tidyverse”, “janitor”, “httr”, “jsonlite”, “kableExtra”, and “here”.\nWe want to look at the already processed data of the Virginia presidential and governor election, so therefore we will be using an RDS already downloaded, which should also be the case if you’d want to individually work with this data. This is how you would do that:\n\n#load saved joined data file from previous script\njoined_vacomparison &lt;- readRDS(\"joined_vacomparison.rds\") #I uploaded this RDS file to my RStudio project, so I just have to tell the program where to look for it\n\nThis way, we have extra columns with percentages and a dataset that is comprised of two previously joined datasets after using the inner_join() and mutate() functions. Here’s a look at the raw data table:\n\nDT::datatable(joined_vacomparison)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK 1)\nInclude code to a new column to the dataset calculating the difference between the percentage of the vote Youngkin received and what Trump received.\nSince we already have very helpful, previously created columns that tell us the percentage of the vote that Youngkin received and the percentage that Trump received, all we have to do is use a simple mutate() equation and name the column.\n\njoined_vacomparison &lt;- joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #this is where the new column we're creating will go\n  mutate( #mutate function to add columns to a data table \n    Youngkin_Trump_difference = (pct_youngkin - trump_pct) #calculating the percentage of youngkin votes - percentage of trump                                                             votes and saving the new column as \"Youngkin_Trump_difference\n  )\n\n\n\nTASK 2)\nUse this new column to find the Top 5 counties with the highest differences between Younkin/Trump percent, and then create a well-labeled chart to visualize them.\nThere’s two steps to this problem. First, we need to find a way to specify the top 5 counties with the highest differences in vote, but that will be easy considering we just made a new column that calculates the difference for us.\n\nhighest_difference_counties = joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #we are calling this new object that contains the biggest differences \"highest_difference_counties\"  \n  arrange(desc(Youngkin_Trump_difference)) %&gt;% #arranging in descending order so we can easily pull the top 5\n  head(5) #function that gives us only the first 5 in the new data table \n\nNow that we have the top five counties according to the difference in the Youngkin vs Trump vote percentages, we can use ggplot to make a chart and visualize them.\n\nggplot(highest_difference_counties, aes(x = reorder(locality, Youngkin_Trump_difference), y = Youngkin_Trump_difference)) +\n  #we are telling ggplot to order the x axis variables based on the y variable, in this case being the difference in the vote percentage \n  geom_col(color = 'black', fill = 'magenta') + #how the chart will be colored \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Difference in Percentage\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"County\") + \n  labs(title = \"Counties with Biggest Difference in Youngkin vs Trump Vote Percentage\") + #naming the chart \n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 0)) #adjusting rotation of the county on x axis so we can clearly read the names of the counties \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK 3)\nCreate a chart that shows the Top 5 counties based on where Youngkin got the highest percentage of the vote\nNow we just need to make a few changes to the process we just did and focus only on Youngkin. It will be another two-step process. First, finding the top 5 counties according to Youngkin’s percentage, then creating the chart.\n\ntop_youngkin_pcts = joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #our new object where the data will be saved \n  arrange(desc(pct_youngkin)) %&gt;% #arranged in descending order according to the pct of the vote youngkin received\n  head(5) #now we can easily take the top 5 counties with the newly sorted data \n\nNow that we’ve distinguished the top 5 counties according to the Youngkin vote, we can make a chart with the data.\n\nggplot(top_youngkin_pcts, aes(x = reorder(locality, pct_youngkin), y = pct_youngkin)) + \n  #we plug in the data to be plotted, then say that we want the x axis to be ordered by the percentage of the youngkin vote, then specify that the y axis will be this percentage\n  geom_col(color = 'magenta', fill = 'purple') + #coloring the chart \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Youngkin Percentage\") + #naming our y axis variables\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"County\") + #naming our x axis variables\n  labs(title = \"Counties with Highest Youngkin Vote Percentage\") + #title of the chart\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 0)) #angling the text of the x axis variables to make them readable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from our newly created chart, the top five counties are all pretty even with each other for this particular comparison.\n\n\nTASK 4)\nCreate a table that shows the Top 5 counties based on where McCauliffe got the highest percentage of the vote\nThe first part of this process will be almost identical to the last, but for a new candidate. Then, we’ll select the variables we wish to display in a table and plug these into the DT function to give us a new table.\nStep 1: organizing the data we’ll be plugging into ggplot:\n\ntop_mccauliffe_pcts = joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #our new object where the data will be saved (now McCauliffe instead of youngkin)\n  arrange(desc(pct_mcauliffe)) %&gt;% #arranged in descending order according to the pct of the vote McCauliffe received\n  head(5) #again can easily take the top 5 counties with the newly sorted data \n\nStep 2: plugging in our new variables to then output an organized, searchable table:\n\nonly_mccauliffe_pcts &lt;- top_mccauliffe_pcts %&gt;% #creating a new object where only the data we want will be stored\n  select(-biden, -trump, -youngkin, -pct_youngkin, -biden_pct, -trump_pct, -Youngkin_Trump_difference)\n#here we are using the select() command to delete columns we don't want in our table, and since right now we are only concerned with McCauliffe's percentage of the vote, that's all we'll need\n\nDT::datatable(only_mccauliffe_pcts) #so when we plug our new object into our DT function, we are left with an organized table of the top counties where McCauliffe's vote percentages were highest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK 5)\nBased on your own analysis, explain a finding of your choosing, include a narrative explaining it to the audience and then create either a chart or table displaying it.\nI thought it would be interesting to only look at counties that had more than 10,000 votes for each presidential candidate and to then see which candidate was more popular with the counties with a larger number of voters. So to do that, I created two new objects that only included counties that fit the 10,000 vote minimum and then looked at, of those counties, how often Biden won vs Trump.\n\nbig_counties &lt;- joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #making a basic data set with only large voting populations so we can use it later \n  filter(biden &gt; 10000, #want biden and trump numbers to be above 10000\n         trump &gt; 10000)\n\nEven though this is all we’ll need for the table, below is how we can see how many times Trump received a higher number of votes in large counties compared to Biden in large counties.\n\nbig_counties_biden &lt;- joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #this will be the object that consists of when Biden had more votes than Trump\n  filter(biden &gt; 10000, #this is the number of Biden votes, which we want to be greater than 10,000\n         trump &gt; 10000, #and this is the number of Trump votes \n         biden &gt; trump) #this line ensures that only counties where Biden had more votes than Trump were pulled from the data\n\nbig_counties_trump &lt;- joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #same thing as last time, except now we're looking for the counties where Trump got more votes than Biden\n  filter(biden &gt; 10000, #same minimum requirements \n         trump &gt; 10000, \n         trump &gt; biden) #we want the number of votes for Trump to be greater than the number of votes for Biden\n\nnrow(big_counties_biden) #by using the nrow() function, we see how many total rows there are in our filtered data sets, which also means it tells us how many counties Biden one, saving us object to use later \"biden_won\"\n\n[1] 21\n\nnrow(big_counties_trump) #and here tells us how many Trump won (or at least, got the larger portion of the vote)\n\n[1] 11\n\n\nWe’ll make a table for our “big_counties” data to be able to easily sift through the data for Trump and Biden votes in counties with large voting populations.\n\nbig_counties_trump_biden &lt;- big_counties %&gt;% #making a new object only with the necessary variables\n  select(-youngkin, -mcauliffe, -pct_youngkin, -pct_mcauliffe, -Youngkin_Trump_difference) #we just want to look at Trump and Biden data in this table, so we get rid of these columns\n\nDT::datatable(big_counties_trump_biden) #use DT to make interactive table for the counties with &gt; 10,000 voters\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we have a table to use for when we only want to see counties that had over 10,000 people vote for both parties in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\nTASK 6)\nBased on your own analysis, explain a second finding of your choosing, include a narrative explaining it to the audience and then create either a chart or table displaying it.\nSince Biden and McCauliffe both ran as representatives of the Democratic party, I thought it would be interesting to analyze how often Biden won when both he and McCauliffe received over 50% of the vote for a county.\n\ndem_win &lt;- joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #new data will be named dem_win and comes from our original data set\n  filter(biden_pct &gt; 50.00, #want biden_pct column over 50\n         pct_mcauliffe &gt; 50.00) %&gt;% #want pct_mccauliffe column over 50 as well\n  select(-trump, -biden, -mcauliffe, -youngkin, -pct_youngkin, -Youngkin_Trump_difference, -trump_pct) #getting rid of any variables that don't have to do with Biden or McCauliffe's pct of the vote \ntotal_dem_win &lt;- nrow(dem_win) #we can use the nrow() function to see how many times Biden and McCauliffe have both won over 50% of the vote, which comes out to be 34\ntotal_dem_win \n\n[1] 34\n\n\nThere are 34 cases in which both Biden and McCauliffe won over 50% of the vote, but we want to see the Biden percentages in those counties. So now we’ll make a chart displaying them.\n\nggplot(dem_win, aes(x = locality, y = biden_pct)) + #using our new dataset with only Biden and McCauliffe getting over 50% of the vote \n  geom_col(color = 'magenta', fill = 'black') + #coloring the chart \n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Biden Percentage\") + #naming our y axis variables\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"County\") + #naming our x axis variables\n  labs(title = \"Biden Percentages in Counties Biden and McCauliffe Won\") + #title of the chart\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0)) #angling the text of the x axis variables to make them readable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK 7)\nBased on your own analysis, explain a third finding of your choosing, include a narrative explaining it to the audience and then create either a chart or table displaying it.\nBecause Youngkin and Trump are both members of the Republican party and McCauliffe and Biden are both members of the Democratic party, I thought it would be interesting to see how often the results of the presidential vs governor election were two different parties. Particularly, I wanted to see when Biden had a larger percentage of the votes but Youngkin won the percentage of the votes for governor. The first thing we need to do to find any of these instances is filter the data.\n\nbiden_youngkin &lt;- joined_vacomparison %&gt;% #new data regarding when Biden and Youngkin both won as they are from different parties\n  filter(biden_pct &gt; trump_pct, #filter so we only see counties where the Biden percentage was higher\n         pct_mcauliffe &lt; pct_youngkin) #and also filter so we only see counties where the Youngkin percentage was higher \n\nNow we want to display these results in a table so we can search the counties of the mixed election results as we please. First, as we have done in the past, we only want to show in the table the columns that are relevant to why the table is being created so:\n\nbiden_youngkin_cleaned &lt;- biden_youngkin %&gt;% #cleaning out the columns we want\n  select(-biden, -trump, -youngkin, -mcauliffe, -Youngkin_Trump_difference) #using the select to delete unnecessary columns\n\nDT::datatable(biden_youngkin_cleaned) #using DT feature to show our new cleaned out data"

    "text": "Completed: Spring 2023\n\nCreating Choropleth Maps in R\n\nPart 1:\nAssignment: Map a continuous variable that is distributed geographically using any data of your choosing without it being simply a map of population density.\n\nFor my first continuous variable to be distributed geographically, I am using a dataset containing the median income for each U.S. county, as of June 2021.\n\nThe next step was cleaning the data, which for this particular step consisted of changing around the variable types, joining the data to a generic county dataset, etc.\n\nNow to see the actual map of the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes/Remarks\nFrom this graph, it can be concluded that a very common income range for U.S. counties is somewhere between $30,000-$60,000. Naturally, the median income by county is very highly linked to the cost of living for that area. The bible belt is especially interesting to see, as the majority of counties from the state of Kentucky downwards all have a similar range of median income. It’s also interesting, yet unsurprising, that the wealthier New England region and San Francisco area tend to have higher overall incomes.\nThis map most effectively communicates not just the data it represents, but also the cost of living across the country, the general trend of population density by county, and even why certain areas of the U.S. swing to one side or another politically.\nThis data is from June 2021, so it would be especially interesting to compare this to mapping of median income by county from a few decades ago to see how the cost of living as a whole has entirely changed.\n\n\n\nPart 2:\nAssignment: Map another continuous variable that is distributed geographically using new data and a new map.\nGoing in a different direction, my second continuous variable to be mapped is the percentage of forest area in each country across the world.\nThe link to the data containing the trend for global forest percentage as well as the download link to the csv file can be found here.\n\n\nNew names:\nRows: 266 Columns: 67\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(4): Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code dbl (31): 1990,\n1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, ... lgl (32): 1960,\n1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, ...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...67`\n\n\n# A tibble: 266 × 67\n   Country N…¹ Count…² Indic…³ Indic…⁴ `1960` `1961` `1962` `1963` `1964` `1965`\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;lgl&gt; \n 1 Aruba       ABW     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 2 Africa Eas… AFE     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 3 Afghanistan AFG     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 4 Africa Wes… AFW     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 5 Angola      AGO     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 6 Albania     ALB     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 7 Andorra     AND     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 8 Arab World  ARB     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n 9 United Ara… ARE     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n10 Argentina   ARG     Forest… AG.LND… NA     NA     NA     NA     NA     NA    \n# … with 256 more rows, 57 more variables: `1966` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1967` &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   `1968` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1969` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1970` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1971` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1972` &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   `1973` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1974` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1975` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1976` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1977` &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   `1978` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1979` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1980` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1981` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1982` &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   `1983` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1984` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1985` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1986` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1987` &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   `1988` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1989` &lt;lgl&gt;, `1990` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1991` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1992` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `1993` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1994` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1995` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1996` &lt;dbl&gt;, `1997` &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nAgain, cleaning the data; this time was a little more complicated, as the country names in the csv file didn’t match many of those in the base dataset.\n\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\n\nNow mapping the data:\n\nlegend_title &lt;- 'Forest Percentage'\n\nHIDDEN_MAP &lt;- \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = forestmapdata, \n               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, \n                   fill = present)) +\n  scale_fill_continuous(legend_title, \n                        low = 'black', \n                        high = 'green') +\n  labs(title = 'Percent of Forest Area by Country', \n       caption = 'The World Bank, 2020') +\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), \n        axis.text = element_blank(), \n        axis.title = element_blank(), \n        axis.ticks = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes/Remarks\nThis map represents the 2020 data regarding the percentage of each country that is covered by forest. The dataset I used actually has some interesting trends to see when it comes to the decades before 2020, and to re-graph each country based on their percentages from many years ago would show that forest area is declining globally.\nFrom this graph alone, however, you can see that denser forest areas normally reside in places that are less populated. It also makes sense that areas like the Saharan Desert, the icecap that is Greenland, and the densely populated middle east have the biggest areas with the lowest forest percentage.\nIt may be more interesting to those concerned with bigger countries like the U.S. or Russia to have the country broken down into different regions instead of taking the average of a large area of land with a vast range of geography and terrain.\nHowever, this map communicates a very easy to understand and reasonable description of the general areas of the world with the most forest area.\n\n\n\nPart 3:\n\na.) Assignment: Using a map you’ve already created, switch the scaling of the variable you were previously using.\nModifying the first map of incomes in the U.S., I’ll switch from a classed scale to a gradient scale, so the output looks like this:\n\n\nRemarks:\nThis data is mapped using a gradient scale rather than a classed scale, and the gradient scale is determined by the data itself, having built-in breaks where the lowest and highest incomes in the dataset are. Because of the breaks, this map does well in communicating the most common incomes for the country as a whole simply by looking at just the legend. However, the differentiation between an income of 60,000 and 140,000 is substantial, and only a small gradient separates these two values (and the same goes for an income of 12,000 compared to 43,000). For this reason, I think the classed scale is the best option to map this data.\n\n\n\nb.) Assignment: Again using a map you’ve already created, switch the scale from sequential to divergent.\nSince my first mapping of this graph used a sequential scale, I’ll switch it now to be on a divergent scale.\nFirst, I want to find the true average of U.S. incomes in the dataset in order to have a meaningful midpoint within the divergent scale.\n\nmean(joined_income_data$Median_HH_Inc_ACS, na.rm=TRUE)\n\nThe average income in the U.S. according to this dataset is $52,640, so I’ll round the midpoint in the diverging scale to $53,000 in order to better comprehend which counties have a median income greater than and less than the true average of the dataset.\n\n\nRemarks:\nI actually find that mapping the median income of U.S. counties on a diverging scale is more meaningful when it comes to seeing which counties are below the poverty line and which are way above it. That being said, because I was using just the median income of this dataset and not a value that draws the line for what income is considered in poverty and what is not, it’s not necessarily correct to conclude that those below the midpoint in the diverging scale are in poverty.\nHowever, it still maps which counties are making less or more than the median U.S. income, and this information is still extremely valuable, especially when it’s mapped across the entire country."

    "text": "Research showing possibility of male birth control pill  \n\nPiper Macke  \n \nFor the first time in history, men might get to understand what it’s like being “on the pill.”  \nA new compound designed to sterilize male mice has shown a 99% efficacy rate over just a four-week testing period. The research is being headed by collaborators at Columbia University and has so far yielded impressive results.  \nChemist and Head of the Department for Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Gunda Georg, Ph.D., spoke in a media briefing last Wednesday on the study.  \n“You have to be careful with this analysis - these are mice; they are not humans, but nevertheless, the effect was very, very promising,” George said. \nThe main challenge in developing the compound currently being tested on mice was targeting a specific protein while still maintaining healthy, viable subjects. \nOne of the greatest promises the research has shown is that the mice that were given the compound for several weeks seemed to have “no side effects whatsoever,” according to Georg. \nFinding a working compound to cause reversible infertility in men is still in the very early stages and won’t be tested on humans until it has been cleared to do so by the Food and Drug Administration.  \nIn which case, the soonest a working birth control pill for males could be developed is about five years from now.  \nStill, the most important indicator of its overall success depends on how willing men are to take it. \nDr. Jesse Mills, director of the Men’s Clinic at UCLA, speculates that the male birth control pill will be significantly more popular among men in committed relationships opposed to men who are not. \nHe also pointed out an important discrepancy in how often men and women use the procedures already available to them.  \n“Our track record as a gender for assuming birth control responsibility is not stellar. Women overwhelmingly outnumber men for going through surgical sterilization procedures even though a female tubal ligation is far more invasive than a vasectomy,” Mills said.  \nWhen a 22-year-old male university student in a committed, heterosexual relationship of several months was anonymously asked if he would take the male birth control pill, he did not hesitate to say yes. \n“My girlfriend has had a tough time with the birth control she’s tried. So, if there was a good birth control pill for men, I would absolutely take it instead,” the source said. \nThe answer differed slightly for a 22-year-old male university student that was not in a relationship.  \n“I wouldn’t be opposed, but I would prefer not to. Kinda scary to think about down the line,” the source said. \nMD Abdullah al Noman, graduate student at the University of Minnesota Institute for Therapeutics Discovery and Development, said that this male-to-female discrepancy occurs as a result of men not having the “trade up” between the side effects of birth control and pregnancy, unlike women.  \nBeing that there are, at minimum, several years before a male birth control pill would be open to use by the public, there is hope that this discrepancy could still be minimized.  \nRegardless, taking the steps to develop a male birth control in the first place is optimistic for millions of women suffering from the harsh side effects of methods that already exist.  \nIf a working oral contraceptive for men is successfully developed, the idea that Georg quoted as “reproductive choice for all” is a real possibility."

    "text": "My experience as a student-athlete\nI am currently a full time student at The George Washington University. For the first three years of college, I had devoted all my time outside of class to being a Division One Women’s Basketball player for GW. While my experience as a student-athlete has taught me extensively about what it means to have discipline, to be adaptable, and to be a part of a team, I’m extremely excited to now focus solely on my studies and career.\nHonest thoughts on my freshman year:\nPlaying basketball has made my college experience extremely unique. After graduating high school in 2020, I was thrown into a life where I was taking all of my classes virtually while experiencing the social newness of university purely in the form of basketball. My teammates from that year quickly became some of the best friends I’ve ever had, and we got through a whirlwind of a year by being together and always leaning on each other for support.\nI say often that I’m glad I made it through that year but also that I’m glad I’ll never have to go back. I had moved into a city I had only visited once, not knowing a single person on the team prior to my arrival, and having never even seen the university before it became my only home. All of the sudden, I was 500 miles away from where I grew up, strictly forbidden from seeing family and any person outside of the team, leaving campus, or getting in a car.\nThoughts on my experience as a whole:\nRecognizing the anomaly of a school year 2020-2021 was, I learned extremely important skills from being a student-athlete for the next years following. Being a collegiate athlete means constant competition: day in, day out, at 5 A.M, at 10 P.M., on no sleep, on the road, at home or in another country. I have always been fiercely competitive, and I am grateful for the part that basketball has played in granting and fostering such a trait.\nAbove all else, my competitiveness was the reason that basketball became my biggest focus in life. The minimum expectation as a Division One athlete is to come every single day ready to give all the energy and passion you have. Any outside thoughts or commitments have no place on the court. That was the way things were, so that’s how I lived.\nHowever, when I started seriously considering what I wanted for my future, I realized how ready I was to take all I had learned and make the next step.\nA deeper look into my experience:\nI always prided myself on how I was not a quitter, would never be a quitter, and didn’t like people who were quitters.\nQuitting basketball was the best decision I have ever made.\nGiven the opportunity to do it over a million times would still have me standing here saying the same.\nI thank basketball for the ways that it has positively affected my life, especially in my work ethic, world view, and mental strength. I believe I took from basketball everything positive it could offer me. I stopped only when I realized that it wasn’t basketball that was going to help me grow in the way that I knew I could - it was everything else I went to school for in the first place.\n\n\nWhy I chose Data Science\nI chose to major in Data Science before I actually knew what it was. I was planning on studying journalism, but the way that my scheduling worked out (luckily) made that impossible. When I met with my academic advisor in utter desperation and no other ideas in mind, I thought back to what classes I had enjoyed taking in previous semesters. One of the first math courses I took in college was an Intro to Statistics class, and it was one of the only classes that I enjoyed for, if nothing else, the challenge. As I walked out of that final exam, I knew I needed to change directions with what I wanted to study.\nI saw that Data Science was a major offered by the university, and then I saw that it had a domain that focused on Data Journalism, and that became my sole focus from then on. I’m happier with that decision than I could ever have imagined, and back then I didn’t even know that I would come to love all of the computer and coding-oriented facets of Data Science."

    "text": "In my first semester of college in 2020, I was given total freedom to choose a topic that I could spend months researching to eventually perfect one of the longest research papers I’d complete in my academic career. Something that I felt particularly strongly for and interested in then (and now) was the stigma and negative perception of female sexuality.\nEspecially as an 18-year-old female in her first year of college (granted it was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic), I saw how the perception of female sexuality was viewed from many different perspectives. So, in researching and creating this paper, I explored what female sexuality looked like through the scope of different regions of the world throughout different decades in history.\n\nFemale Sexuality: How the Historical Perception Influences the Contemporary View\n\nPiper Macke\nAbstract\nDespite society having begun to evolve to make feminine sexuality less taboo, the historical perception of women and sex has led it to be an issue that is still frowned upon and does not receive the same attention as its male counterpart. The project aims to support why this topic should be implemented more seriously into education as a possible first step in solving it as an issue on the basis of persisting male and female inequality. Historical and contemporary examples of female sexuality are presented to highlight how the negative foundation it was developed upon has influenced how it is seen today. The project discusses historical factors that impact the way the world currently sees feminine sexuality such as premartial sex, gender norms, and societal expectations. In addition, contemporary examples of pornography consumption, motives for sex, and commonly-believed sexual myths are included to highlight how these historical instances have paved the way for a underrepresented, undereducated,  viewpoint on women and sex.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThough it’s become less taboo to discuss female sexuality in the modern world, there still exist numerous misconceptions regarding its realities. The way male and female sexuality is discussed in a formal and informal context shows a stark difference in societal opinion, and this divide leads to a lack of understanding of women and sex. For example, looking to Cindy Meston and Amelia Stanton’s scholarly article entitled “Recent Findings on Women\\’s Motives for Engaging in Sexual Activity,” it was proven through a variety of questionaires that women have sex for the same reasons men do, though it is rarely discussed, especially in a positive manner. In this article, women were asked to classify their motives for sex into one or more of four main categories, being: Physical, goal attainment, emotional, and insecurity. Not surprisingly, it was found that women in different relationship stages (i.e. single, dating, married, recently out of a breakup, etc.) responded differently. However, most notable from this survey is that women who were single and engaging in casual sex were most motivated by physical factors, whether it be attraction to their partner or personal pleasure (Meston and Stanton, 2017). While this in itself is not surprising, it is a fact that both holds a negative connotation in society and is very infrequently discussed in the same manner it is with men also being motivated purely out of physical factors. Because this discussion does not extend to women engaging in the same behavior, it is perceived more wrongful than natural even though there exists no solid foundation to support such a belief.\nPerhaps a reasoning for this lack of female representation as it relates to discussions about sexuality is the fact that women are perceived to have lower sex drives than their male counterparts. Therefore, the idea that they may be engaging in sexual activity to the same degree as men comes as a shock as it does not seem feasible. However, this assumption has been proven false on various occasions. In Katherine Rowland\\’s article in which she herself interviewed 120 women of different ages across the country, she concluded that the perceived lower sex drive of women is, \\“less the result of faulty biology than evidence of sound judgment\\” (Rowland, 2020). What she goes on to explain further is that, while all women suffer dips in sexual desire at different points in their lives, it is more so because of less-than-satisfactory sex than it is because of a reluctance to engage in sexual activity in the first place. While this itself is not surprising, it is a result of a lack of education of the female anatomy and a suppression of the conversation about feminine sexuality as to advance the discussion of male sexuality as its primary concern.\nIt is also important to mention that this lack of attention to sexually active women stems from the continued historical suppression and repelling of the idea of female sexuality. Such an instance is relayed in Lynn Botelho’s “Old women and sex: fear, fantasy, and a defining life course in Early Modern Europe.” In her scholarly article, Botelho mentions how the perception of feminine sexuality is partially formed by the historical view of witchcraft that aimed to defile the teachings of Christianity. Early modern social order enforced the role of women to be that of the housewife; they were expected to do the cleaning, cooking, and nurturing of their children. Witches, on the other hand, “foiled the process of creation” (Botehlo, 2015) with their threat to society’s sexual repression of women and expectation to engage in reproduction. Likewise, women that were old enough to no longer have a house to keep, children to foster, or a husband to satisfy were also opposers to the teachings of celibacy and purity that Christianity so heavily enforced. As a result, the constant fear of what witches and old women tempted sexually remained a justification for the suppression of their sexuality. This suppression only persisted throughout history as there were no real movements to combat it for centuries.\nIn addressing the issue of how female sexuality is negatively perceived today, I hope to give historical instances where it can be clearly seen that it is the result of an existing problem. I hope to also include justification as to why it is important to address the reality of sexually active women as a necessary step in closing the patriarchal divide between men and women in all areas of life. With the several articles, testimonies, and facts I have reviewed, I have found multiple instances that indicate how doing so is a viable and imperative solution to solving this problem. With an education more focused on the health of both men and women in a sexual context, the collective attitude towards feminine sexuality can be transformed into one that is accepted as positive and necessary to advance an ideally equal society.\n\n\nMethods \nIn conducting my research, I sought to find a variety of sources regarding the date they were published and/or the era in which they gave information about. I wanted to give information both on the historical perception of female sexuality as well as the contemporary viewpoint. That being so, I primarily utilized GW’s virtual library databases. I used JSTOR to collect most of my sources, using keywords such as “women,” “sex,” “sexuality,” and “female sexuality” to find the large part of my scholarly sources. \nI knew from personal experience how men and women are spoken of differently when it pertains to their sexual activity, and I aimed to explore why this occurred and how it may be linked to the historical suppression of female sexuality. What I found proved my hypothesis, being that most of the historical documents I read and included showed that the reason for this suppression is a result of a long-living historical trend. In my methodology, I hoped to provide solutions for how the gradual introduction into this conversation may occur. \nIn selecting the sources I would go on to use in my project, I considered if they were credible and had sufficient information for the points I wanted to make. Therefore, I attempted to use more scholarly journals instead of other forms of research even though it may have made my points much clearer. I wanted the research I included to be a continuation of my argument for a more natural integration of female sexuality into existing conversation, not for the research to be my argument. \nIn the sources I used that were not scholarly or peer reviewed, I made sure the author, organization, and research methods were reliable before including them. Some of the information I sought to find was too specific for a scholarly journal, so I looked to other organizations that may have begun their own research in the field of feminine sexuality. \nOverall, the research I chose to include in my project is reliable and serves as a continuation of my argument regarding women and sex. I aim to interpret the outside research I use in a manner that advances my personal observations of the discussion of sex in the modern world.\n\n\n\n\nResults\nHistorical Perspective\nTo advance aforementioned points regarding how male and female sexual activity is viewed differently, Lindsay Moore supports in her academic journal “Single Women and Sex in the Early Modern Atlantic World” that there are numerous instances in which the different views on the same behavior of men and women became apparent in a legal regard. In 17th century England, women were frequently brought to court on accounts of engaging in illegal sexual activity. They then had to rely on claims such as a “broken marriage contract” or being seduced and coerced by their master to prove their innocence and hope for their acquittal (Moore, 2010). Occurrences such as these were very common in the early modern world, and advance a further issue when it is also noted that the male counterparts of actions such as forniaction and bastardy were prosecuted much less frequently. As Moore mentions in her article, this is partly due to the collective attitude towards sex and gender as well as the socioeconomic status of the women involved. Women were easily discredited as authorities in England and Massachusetts Bay relied on Protestant teachings as a justification for their judgements.\nReliance upon religious teachings to justify certain attitudes towards sex is a theme that is extremely frequent throughout history. However, there are certain occasions that serve as a counterpoint to this very rigid commonality. For example, in Nancy Landale and Avery Guest’s scholarly article entitled “Ideology and Sexuality among Victorian Women,” research is cited by Stanford historian Carl Delger in which sexual relations among Victorian women “‘were neither rejected nor engaged in with distaste or reluctance’” (Guest and Landale, 1986). Essentially, this then serves to contrast the very opposite viewpoint that existed in most other time periods and areas around the world. This trend is also very rare and serves as one of the very few examples of women in history being able to freely express and converse about their sexuality. \nContemporary Perspective\nAs time goes on and social interaction becomes more reliant on technology and online apps, the sexuality of women is affected in a different way that involves a constant comparison to those they are exposed to online. In furthering this claim, Stefanie Davis cites in her academic journal entitled “Objectification, Sexualization, and Misrepresentation: Social Media and the College Experience” dozens of examples in which social media conversation served as the medium for discussions about female sexualization, the male gaze, gender roles, and how celebrities on such a platform are held in such a high regard speaking on these issues. One of the important points Davis mentions in her article is how social media can also perpetuate rape culture, as the internet serves as a, “celebration of male sexual conquests, slut shaming, and sexualization of women” (Davis, 2018). Such an occurrence stems from the fact that those with the most influence or strongest opinions are usually at the forefront of such conversations online. Therefore, anyone may be subjected to a discussion that is headed by those with outdated or wrongful perceptions of issues such as female sexuality. \nIn contrast, the same social media discussions affect the opposite end of the spectrum, as “postfeminist empowerment” is displayed by popular celebrities advocating for women to be comfortable in their bodies and sexuality. For example, Davis also mentions how popular child Disney star Miley Cyrus once posted on Twitter that she was a “freak” to empower herself and her impressionable followers. With this being one of many instances of Cyrus publicly breaking the mold of innocent young actors, she was constantly met with backlash. While there have been countless celebrities that saw a negative reaction from the rest of society for similar displays, it presents the very common response to women expressing themselves in ways they are not expected to. \nIt is also important to mention that there would be no need for celebrities to advocate for feminine sexual health, education, or empowerment if it was seen in the same manner as its male counterparts. Social media stars would not need to come forward as heroes of modern feminism if it wasn’t a problem that was cemented into the foundations of society. While doing so is a very necessary step in breaking down the negative perception of female sexuality now, it is a problem that could’ve been avoided with adequate education and societal acceptance. \n\n\nDiscussion\nMy argument here advances in that if the conversation about female sexuality were to be encouraged throughout history rather than shunned or silenced, there would be much less of a divide in the way men and women are treated in every area of work, education, society, and life in general. In the beginning of the 20th century, the mere recognition of feminine sexuality was a new idea in itself. When it was looked into even further, it was collectively agreed upon that this revolutionary idea was different than that of the male and, as stated by Michael Gordon and Penelope Shankweiler, “essentially dependent upon him for its arousal and satisfaction\\” (Gordon and Shankweiler, 1971). Women were therefore not seen as beings with needs that were independent of male influence, and this attitude is one that lives on within many different spheres of life. \nThis viewpoint only advances the already patriarchal makeup of society insofar as that it presents a foundation for men to be seen as superior to women. Through this perspective, men are a necessary force in a woman’s awakening of sexual desire, not accounting for the fact that this awakening could be completely due to other factors. In addition, this attitude lends itself to the favoring of females with certain “desirable” traits. With a subconscious belief that women are to be introduced to male-dominated activity, it’s also reasonable to believe that this would lead to certain females being favored within society if they are seen as more submissive. In a study conducted by Pew Research Center in which 4,573 Americans answered the question of what words society uses to describe men and women, there is a very obvious trend that presents their desirable and undesirable traits. Women that were “beautiful” were always talked about positively, as well as if they were “kind” or “compassionate.” Men, on the other hand, were discussed positively if they presented themselves as “strong,” “honest,” or “powerful” (Bialik et al., 2021). When women were described as having these characteristics, it was much more commonly seen as a negative trait. While this is only one glaring example of how men are seen as the dominant sex socially, it can easily be translated to the way they are expected to be dominant sexually as well.\nIt is also shocking that the results of Donald Mosher’s (1979) study of sexual myths seem to refute the proclaimed superiority of men in a sexual context. In a survey of almost 100 male and female students at the University of Connecticut, 41 sexual myths were presented to the subjects and they were to decide themselves if they were true or not based on their prior knowledge. In the survey, men reported believing significantly more myths than women, with most being focused on the female side of sexual intercourse, such as orgasm or masturbation. Mosher attributes this tendency of men to believe sexual myths to both the “homosocial” male conversation regarding sex and pornography catered towards the male population (Mosher, 1979). This occurrence is clearly the result of a lack of education, though it could be from a variety of subjects such as female health, anatomy, biology, or sexual education in general. It is because of this proven tendency that it must become more of a priority to educate both men and women about the realities of sex as to both normalize this basic human behavior and decrease sexual guilt. \nIf the historical norms that created the stigma surrounding female sexuality continue to be a functioning aspect of society, it will only further the divide between men and women in every area of life. Young, impressionable girls and boys are constantly at risk of misinformation, especially as internet access gets exponentially easier. If the historical perception of women and sex is one that continues to be of lesser regard than male sexuality, it is likely that the lack of education and awareness surrounding the topic will never be fixed. \nThe need for sexual education especially of the youth that is just becoming introduced to new desires is essential. In the various studies that I have included, it is clear that there exists a very obvious lack of knowledge regarding the female side of any sexual activity. This is evident for both men and women and serves as a problem that must be solved as to consequently aid in the resolving of other aspects of society that deem women as inferior to men.\nAs technology continues to reach a wider and more diverse audience, this education may begin in the form of social media apps or with the help of popular celebrities. It can be argued that in the 21st century there exists a new sexual revolution that recognizes female sexuality and sees sex itself as a basic human need. However, the resolution to the continued lack of education regarding the masculine and feminine side of sexuality lies in the fact that this sexual revolution must be wholly accepted and nurtured into society.\n\n\nReferences\nBialik, K., Kessel, P., & Walker, K.
