# Dear Data Project

The following is a graph representing my studying habits over the course of a week about two weeks into the beginning of the spring semester. I'm taking 4 classes this semester, with each of them included in the graph below.

Many different aspects of each hand-drawn butterfly represent a different facet of the data. The colors, patterns, size, and background color of each butterfly indicates different specifications regarding my studying habits for the day that butterfly represents. The legend for how to read this graph is as follows, including an important message regarding the data itself:

You can see in this hand-drawn legend that color corresponds to class, size to total hours spent studying, design to overall enjoyment level, background color to whether or not I studied alone, and the body to the location where I did the majority of my studying.
