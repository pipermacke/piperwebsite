title: "Research Paper"
editor: visual

In my first semester of college in 2020, I was given total freedom to choose a topic that I could spend months researching to eventually perfect one of the longest research papers I'd complete in my academic career. Something that I felt particularly strongly for and interested in then (and now) was the stigma and negative perception of female sexuality. 

Especially as an 18-year-old female in her first year of college (granted it was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic), I saw how the perception of female sexuality was viewed from many different perspectives. So, in researching and creating this paper, I explored what female sexuality looked like through the scope of different regions of the world throughout different decades in history.
