### My experience as a student-athlete

I'm a full time student as a senior at The George Washington University. For the first three years of college, I had devoted all my time outside of class to being a Division One Women's Basketball player for GW. While my experience as a student-athlete has taught me extensively about what it means to have discipline, to be adaptable, and to be a part of a team, I'm extremely excited to now focus solely on my studies and career.

*Honest thoughts on my freshman year:*

Playing basketball has made my college experience extremely unique. After graduating high school in 2020, I was thrown into a life where I was taking all of my classes virtually while experiencing the social newness of university purely in the form of basketball. My teammates from that year quickly became some of the best friends I've ever had, and we got through a whirlwind of a year by being together and always leaning on each other for support.

I say often that I'm glad I made it through that year but also that I'm glad I'll never have to go back. I had moved into a city I had only visited once, not knowing a single person on the team prior to my arrival, and having never even seen the university before it became my only home. All of the sudden, I was 500 miles away from where I grew up, strictly forbidden from seeing family and any person outside of the team, leaving campus, or getting in a car.

*Thoughts on my experience as a whole:*

Recognizing the anomaly of a school year 2020-2021 was, I learned extremely important skills from being a student-athlete for the next years following. Being a collegiate athlete means constant competition, and not just against the other team; every day you compete to show you are not replaceable.

The minimum expectation as a Division One athlete is to come every single day ready to give all the energy and passion you have. Any outside thoughts or commitments have no place on the court.

When I started seriously looking to succeed in my studies and career rather than on the court, I realized how ready I was to take the next step.

*A deeper look into my experience:*

I always prided myself on how I was not a quitter, would never be a quitter, and didn't like people who were quitters.

But quitting basketball was the best decision I have ever made.

Given the opportunity to do it over a million times would still have me standing here saying the same.

I thank basketball for the ways that it has positively affected my life, especially in my work ethic, world view, and mental strength. I believe I took from basketball everything positive it could offer me. I stopped playing when I realized that it wasn't basketball that was going to help me grow in the way that I knew I could - it was everything else I went to school for in the first place.

### Why I chose Data Science

I chose to major in Data Science before I actually knew what it was. I was planning on studying journalism, but the way that my scheduling worked out (luckily) made that impossible. When I met with my academic advisor in utter desperation and no other ideas in mind, I thought back to what classes I had enjoyed taking in previous semesters. One of the first math courses I took in college was an Intro to Statistics class, and it was one of the only classes that I enjoyed for, if nothing else, the challenge. As I walked out of that final exam, I knew I needed to change directions with what I wanted to study.

I saw that Data Science was a major offered by the university, and then I saw that it had a domain that focused on Data Journalism, and that became my sole focus from then on. I'm happier with that decision than I could ever have imagined, and back then I didn't even know that I would come to love all of the computer and coding-oriented facets of Data Science.
